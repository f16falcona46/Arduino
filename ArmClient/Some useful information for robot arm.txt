REMEMBER TO RUBBER BAND!!!!!!1!11one


Send 13 bytes
Byte  1: MUST be 255, helps it sync, I think
    2-3: Value, in microseconds, of rotator base
    4-5: Value, in microseconds, of elevator base 
    6-7: Value, in microseconds, of elbow
    8-9: Value, in microseconds, of wrist
  10-11: Value, in microseconds, of right finger
  12-13: Value, in microseconds, of left finger
2byte values are arranged like this:
Say we have a value 1000101011110000
it gets split into 10001010 11110000
if it's byte 2-3 then
                   10001010 11110000
                    ^byte 2  ^byte 3

Try 1400us as a default value.

Note: Try to make it so that each byte except the sync byte isn't 255, since it
	might mess it up. It might not, though, so YMMV.

Plug the red wire of the battery clip into the "+" rail (a hole labeled "+")
Plug the black wire of the battery clip into the "-" rail (labeled "-")
It will be communicating via USB serial port. I think it is ttyusbX or something
	X is probably 0 or 1
The baud rate is 115000 8bits+no parity+1 stop bit, true (not inverted). There's probably
	docs online that tell you how to set these parameters. I think ioctl has something to
	do with it.

The pin assignments are as follows:
6: rotator base
7: elevator base
8: elbow
9: wrist
10: right finger
11: left finger

It uses servos, changing the length of the pulse changes the position of the servo.
I'm not sure if increasing the pulse width makes it go clockwise or the other way round.
Note that the left and right fingers have to rotate in opposite directions.

Try maintaining an array of bool and update whenever read doesn't return -1

This uses the Servo library in the Wiring collection of Arduino libraries in case
you need to write that in the technical documentation.

The Arduino it uses is a 32K Arduino Nano clone with CH340G USB-Serial converter chip, in
	case you need to add that in the documentation.
	We use a 9V battery which is actually a rechargeable Li-ion battery with 2 cells of
	3.7V each, for a total of 8.4V: this is done in order to allow higher currents than
	possible with normal alkaline batteries.
	
Make sure to note that the computer actually runs off of less than 14.4V at each point!
(11.1V max)




and remember that YOU GOTTA RALLY!!
